This work is the summary of rotation in Guy's Lab at IQB, Rutgers. It is a general guide of NMR protein prediction for L22 protein using CYANA, ASDP with CYANA and ASDP with XPLOR, respectively. In this work, I will describe the pipeline of running each program and how to analyze results by PSVS, a powerful analysis tool for protein prediction. It also contains the examples of several PDBstat usages which helps generate or modify files for input or PSVS analysis.  
## List of programs included
1. CYANA: Automated NMR Structure Calculation Program. For more information about the method, check out the [https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-809-9:353] and tutorial.
