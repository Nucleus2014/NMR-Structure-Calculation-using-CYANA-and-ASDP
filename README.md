# NMR-Structure-Calculation-using-CYANA-and-ASDP
Changpeng Lu  
This work is the summary of rotation in Guy's Lab at IQB, Rutgers. It is a general guide of NMR protein prediction for L22 protein using CYANA, ASDP with CYANA and ASDP with XPLOR, respectively. In this work, I will describe the pipeline of running each program and how to analyze results by PSVS, a powerful analysis tool for protein prediction. It also contains the examples of several PDBstat usages which helps generate or modify files for input or PSVS analysis.  
## List of programs included
1. CYANA: Automated NMR Structure Calculation Program. For more information about the method, check out the [paper](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-809-9:353) and [tutorial](http://www.cyana.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).  
2. ASDP: Automated Determination Program of Protein Structures from NMR Data. For more information about the method, check out the [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/prot.20820) and simple [tutorial](http://www.nmr2.buffalo.edu/nesg.wiki/AutoStructure_Structure_Determination_Program).  
3. PSVS: Protein Structure Validation Software suite. PSVS could be accessed through the [link](http://psvs-1_5-dev.nesg.org/) and simple [tutorial](http://www.nmr2.buffalo.edu/nesg.wiki/PSVS).  
4. Pdbstat: Analysis, conversion, and manipulation of coordinate and constraint files for protein structure determination. For more information about the method, check out the [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10858-013-9753-7) and simple [tutorial](http://www.nmr2.buffalo.edu/nesg.wiki/PdbStat).
